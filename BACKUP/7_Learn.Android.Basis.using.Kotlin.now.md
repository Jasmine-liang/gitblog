# [Learn Android Basis using Kotlin now](https://github.com/Jasmine-liang/gitblog/issues/7)

Got more familiar using Material theme now, and learned a lot about:
- write clear and clean code
- user experience, like adding `ScrollView` to prevent element from being truncated . This websize helps with Material tools: [Resources - Material Design](https://material.io/resources)     

             
Also I made an app along the course named TipTime which calculates the tip. Ref: [Android-basis: TipTime](https://github.com/Jasmine-liang/Android-basis)

Now into the second App, **Affirmations app**. Here are the notes token.
- In Kotlin, the `vararg` modifier allows you to pass a variable number of arguments of the same type into a function or constructor.
- _Adapter_ is a design pattern that adapts the data into something that can be used by RecyclerView, [Use RecyclerView to display a scrollable list](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-kotlin-unit-2-pathway-3%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list#3)

Finally done! I added the seven affirmations that I always recall during meditation.
Ok I push my finished code in here: [Jasmine-liang/Android-basis](https://github.com/Jasmine-liang/Android-basis)
